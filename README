#Real Time Bus Tracker

<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>This program was created to complete a project for MIT, it's goal was to track the location of a bus.  Currrently the program accomplishes this task.</p>

<h2>How to Run:</h2>
<p>All you have to do to run the program is to first install the files, keep them in the same folder, and launch the index.html file.  It will automatically open a map and every so often, move the marker that is tracking the location.</p>

<h2>Roadmap:</h2>
<p>I plan on eventually moving the script information to a .js file.  Currently, the script does not work outside of the main index file.</p>

<h2>License Information:</h2>
<p>This program's components were obtained from the MIT full time programming course, under the official MIT Copyright and License./p>
